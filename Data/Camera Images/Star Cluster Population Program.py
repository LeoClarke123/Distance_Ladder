This program sorts through the "total point-like data.txt" file in relation with the "star clusters.txt" file to identify the stars which are within each star cluster.
This program outputs a .txt document for each star cluster with the data for all of the stars within the cluster (in the same format as "total point-like data.txt").

Of course, this program requires those two files in the same working directory. This program also names the star clusters. Currently, the naming convention is:
    X{coord}-Y{coord}-N{population}.txt
